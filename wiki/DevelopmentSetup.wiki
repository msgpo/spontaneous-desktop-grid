#summary Setup and configuration of development environment.
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

= Requirements =

 * jdk-6 (jdk-5 is not possible because we are using couple of methods from jdk-6)
 * Eclipse >= 3.2

 _it is possible that we relax requirements to jdk-5 later_

= SIP Communicator =

== Checkout or download ==

Checkout SIP Communicator (SC) from the SC SVN repository or download latest version.

 * for checkout see [http://www.sip-communicator.org/index.php/Development/VersionControl SC SVN page]
   # you need to become observer of SC project (send request via dev.java.net and wait for the project leader confirmation, may take time)
   # in Eclipse open https://sip-communicator.dev.java.net/svn/sip-communicator SVN repository
   # checkout trunk (may take up to 10 minutes)
     * it is suggested you rename it to 'sip-communicator'
 * *or* download latest version
   # the latest nightly build works fine

== Configure and compile ==

 # copy `.project` and `.classpath` files from `ide/eclipse` to the project root (hint: use _resource_ perspective)
   * you may need to remove a couple of missing libraries from the build path
   * you may need to fix `ant.jar` location in the build path (use `variable -> ECLIPSE_HOME -> extend`)
 # remove excessive `jdic_stub.jar`s from the build path (otherwise you may get error with the tray icon)
 # convert project to PDE project
   * right click on project -> PDE tools -> convert
 # open `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` -> runtime and export all _net.java.sip.communicator_ packages
 # fix any errors
 # run ant with `build.xml make`
 # run ant with `build.xml run` (this copies OS-specific bundles to the right place, and starts SIP Communicator)

= F2F =

== checkout ==

 # checkout java/F2F from the [http://code.google.com/p/spontaneous-desktop-grid/source repository]

== apply patch to SC project ==

 # apply the patch file "Sip Communicator patch.txt" as a patch to SC project in Eclipse (project's context menu -> Team -> Apply patch)
 # build SC
 
== compile ==

 # fix any errors
 # run ant with `build.xml make`

== configure and run ==

 # run SIP
   * set class to _net.java.sip.communicator.launcher.SIPCommunicator_
   * set VM arguments to (replace `linux` with your operating system)
