#summary Setup and configuration of development environment.
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

= Requirements =

 * jdk-6 (jdk-5 is not possible because we are using couple of methods from jdk-6)
 * eclipse >=3.2 (not sure about 3.3 - confirmed to work)

 _it is possible that we relax requirements to jdk-5 later_

   # checkout trunk (may take up to 10 minutes)
     * it is suggested you rename it to 'sip-communicator'
 * *or* download latest version
   # the latest nightly build works fine

== Configure and compile ==

 # copy `.project` and `.classpath` files from `ide/eclipse` to the project root (hint: use _resource_ perspective)
   * you may need to remove a couple of missing libraries from the build path
   * you may need to fix `ant.jar` location in the build path (use `variable -> ECLIPSE_HOME -> extend`)
 # remove excessive `jdic_stub.jar`s from the build path (otherwise you may get error with the tray icon)
 # convert project to PDE project
   * right click on project -> PDE tools -> convert
 # open `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` -> runtime and export all _net.java.sip.communicator_ packages
 # fix any errors
 # run ant with `build.xml make`
