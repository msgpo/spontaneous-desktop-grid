= Configuration =

3 computers:
  * Vladimir/Inspire
    * Ethernet connection
    * using MSN account temp_777@hotmail.com
  * Vladimir/ENIAC
    * WiFi connection
    * using MSN account voviss@gmail.com
  * Artjom
    * WiFi connection
    * using MSN account artjom85@ut.ee or one of Artjom's Jabber accounts for multi-protocol tests

Ulrich's laptop will be used for showing the slides.

= Presentation =

  * Introducing the team - Ulrich
  * Introductionary talk - Andres A.
    * Explaining what is going to be demonstrated, etc
  * Demos of distributed processes
    * F2F applications
      * Using Blender to render an animation (to be found/created) with ~100 frames
      * Computing Pi with the Monte Carlo method, using 100 billion points
    * Connection
      * Demonstrating TCP/IP communication if possible (otherwise using SIP IM channel)
      * No UDP punching yet
    * Chat demonstration
      * Case 1 (MSN; Ethernet -> WiFi x 2)
        * Vladimir/Inspire initates chat with Artjom
        * Vladimir/Inspire adds Vladimir/ENIAC to the chat
        * Message sending is tested by everyone
        * Vladimir/Inspire kicks Artjom from the chat
        * Artjom verifies that he's been notified of this and can no longer communicate from that window
        * Vladimir/ENIAC verifies that Artjom no longer shows up in the participants list
        * The remaining computers test sending messages and verify that Artjom receives nothing
      * Case 2 (MSN; WiFi -> Ethernet)
        * Artjom initiates chat with Vladimir/Inspire
        * Message sending is tested both ways
        * Vladimir/ENIAC leaves chat
        * Artjom verifies that he can no longer send messages to Vladimir/ENIAC from that window
      * Case 3 (MSN; WiFi -> WiFi)
        * Artjom initiates chat with Vladimir/ENIAC
        * Message sending is tested both ways
        * Artjom ends the chat
        * Vladimir/ENIAC verifies that he can no longer send messages to Artjom from that window
      * Case 4 (MSN; WiFi -> WiFi & Ethernet)
        * Artjom initiates chat with Vladimir/ENIAC
        * Artjom adds Vladimir/Inspire to the chat
        * Message sending is tested by everyone
        * Vladimir/ENIAC leaves the chat
        * The remaining computers test sending messages and verify that Vladimir/ENIAC receives nothing
      * Case 5 (multi-protocol)
        * Repeat some or all of the cases using Artjom's Jabber account instead.
    * Demos will be accompanied by explaining slides, graphs, etc.
  * Proofs (showing that the system really works the way we're claiming)
    * Showing logs and explaining
      * SIP / Socket communication
      * Firewall

= To-do =

  * Organising the presentation - creating slides (in OpenOffice format), gathering material from others, etc.
*Artjom and Madis*
  * Graphs and slides explaining the communication
*Jaan*
  * Slides about chat
*JÃ¼rmo*
  * Slides about Blender
