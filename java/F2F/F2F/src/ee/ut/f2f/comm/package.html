F2F communication layer provides three essential interfaces (plus one internal
interface) and one base exception with
three derived exceptions and also communication protocol independent part of
implementation.
<p>
Current implementation does not support support dynamically installed plugins.
<p>
Base interface is CommunicationLayer that provides methods for user information,
message sending and connection listener (which helps develop server functionality).
<p>
Usage of this package should start with creating one of CommunicationLayer interface
instances (via CommunicationFactory class).
<p>
Second important interface is User. User interface provides basic user information
and helps send message to corresponding user.
<p>
CommunicationListener interface provides access to CommunicationLayer generated
events. Class CommunicationListenerImpl with base implementation is provided to
easy usage of this interface.
<p>
Base exception is CommunicationException. All other exceptions are derived from this
one.
